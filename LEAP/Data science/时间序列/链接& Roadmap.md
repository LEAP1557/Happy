Others：
AR--AR Model is a special case of ARIMA (autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model.
Strong autocorrelation (positive or negative) at a lag K larger than 1 and its multiples (2k, 3k, ...) typically reflects a cyclical pattern.
• Positive lag-1 autocorrelation (called “stickiness’’) describes a series where consecutive values move generally in the same direction.
• Negative lag-1 autocorrelation reflects swings in the series, where high values are immediately followed by low values and vice versa.
