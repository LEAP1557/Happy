## A

### ACF
Autocorrelation function. This term is used to describe the correlation between values of the same time series with its lagged values. The ACF is frequently used to identify the order of a moving average model MA(q). The ACF of a true MA(q) model will be zero after the qth lag. A plot of the ACF against the lag is known as the correlogram.

**AIC:** Akaike’s Information Criterion. The AIC provides a measure of the goodness-of-fit of a model which takes into account the number of terms in the model. It is commonly used to compare ARIMA models against competing ARIMA models. The AIC is equal to twice the number of parameters in the model minus twice the log of the maximum value of the likelihood function. The theory behind the AIC was developed by Hirotogu Akaike and is based on “entropy maximization”.

**ARIMA:** An abbreviation for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average which is used to forecast a single time series. It has 3 parts: AR (p) -auto regressive, I(d) -integrated and MA (q)- moving average. The model is often denoted ARIMA(p,d,q).

**Asset:** A tangible or intangible item that can be possessed to produce economic value.

**Autocorrelation:** See ACF.

**Autoregressive (AR) model:** Autoregression is a form of regression, but instead of the variable to be forecast being related to other explanatory variables, it is related to past values of itself at varying time lags. In other words, an autoregressive model would express the forecast as a function of previous values of that time series.

## B

### Backtest:
The process of validating and analysis a trading strategy based on historical data.

**BIC:** Bayesian Information Criterion. Like the AIC, the BIC is an model selection criteria for ARIMA models. It was developed by Gideon E. Schwarz (1978).

## C

### CAL
**Capital Allocation Line (CAL):** A line that graphs the risk of portfolios that are a combination of a portfolio of risky assets risk-free assets.

**Confidence interval**: Based on statistical and probability theory, a confidence interval is calculated from observed data to estimate the value of an unobserved population value such as the mean. The confidence interval represents the range of values of the population parameter such that the difference between the population parameter and the estimate is not significant at the level of the confidence interval.

**Correlation coefficient:** A standardized measure of the association between two variables, say X and Y. Commonly designated as r, its values range from −1 to +1, indicating strong negative relationship, to strong positive association. Values close to zero mean no linear relationship. The correlation coefficient is calculated as the covariance standardized with the standard deviations of the tow random variables.

**Covariance:** This is a measure of the joint variation between two random variables, X and Y. The range of covariance values is unrestricted (large negative to large positive). However, if the X and Y variables are first standardized, then covariance is the same as correlation and the range of covariance (correlation) values is from −1 to +1.

**Critical value:** In hypothesis testing, the critical value is the threshold for significance. A test statistic beyond the critical value gives a significant result.

## D
### Differencing
**Differencing:** 
When a time series is non-stationary, it can often be made stationary by taking differences of the series—that is, creating a new time series of successive differences (Xt−Xt−1). If first differences do not convert the series to stationary form, then first differences of first differences can be created. This is called second-order differencing. A distinction is made between a second-order difference (just defined) and a second difference (X_t−X_{t−2}Xt​−Xt−2​).

**Diversification:** It is the process of allocating capital in a way that reduces the exposure to any one particular asset or risk.

## E

**Efficient Frontier:** A set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.

## F

**Forecast error**: A forecast error is calculated by subtracting the forecast value from the actual value to give an error value for each forecast period. An error is the difference between the forecast obtained from the model and the actual value.

**Function:** A function is a statement of relationship between variables. Virtually all of the quantitative forecasting methods involve a functional relationship between the item to be forecast and either previous values of that item, previous error values, or other explanatory variables.

## I

**Integrated:** This is often an element of time series models (the I in ARIMA models) and indicates the number of differences needed to get a covariance-stationary time series.

## L

**Lag:** A difference in time periods between an observation and a previous observation. Thus Y_{t−k}Yt−k​ lags Y_tYt​ by k periods.

**Long:** When an investor buys an asset, the investor is said to have a long position.

## M

**Mean:** The arithmetic average or mean for a group of items is defined as the sum of the values of the items divided by the number of items. It is frequently used as a measure of a central tendency for a frequency or probability distribution.

**Minimum Variance Portfolio:** The point on the efficient frontier that represents the portfolio with the least variance.

**Model:** A model is the symbolic representation of reality. In quantitative forecasting methods a specific model is used to represent the basic pattern contained in the data. This may be a regression model, which is explanatory in nature, or a time series model.

**Momentum:** Rate of rise or fall of an asset price.

## N
### Non-stationary
**Non-stationary:** 
A time series exhibits non-stationarity if the underlying generating process does not have a constant mean and/or a constant variance.

## P

**Parameter:** Characteristics of a population such as the mean or standard deviation are called parameters. These should be distinguished from the characteristics of a sample taken from a population, which are called statistics.

**Partial Autocorrelation:** This measure of correlation is used to identify the extent of relationship between current values of a variable with earlier values of that same variable (values for various time lags) while holding the effects of all other time lags constant.

**Portfolio:** A collection of assets held by an investor.

**Position:** Refers to the ownership of the asset.

**P-value:** Used in hypothesis testing. The P value is the probability of obtaining a result as extreme as the one calculated from the data, if the hypothesis to be demonstrated is not true.

## R
### Random walk
**Random walk:** Random walk is a time series model which states that each observation is equal to the previous observation plus some random step.

**Regression:** A term “regression” dates back to Sir Francis Galton and his work with the heights of siblings in different generations. The heights of children of exceptionally tall (or short) parents “regress” to the mean of the population. Regression analysis today means any modeling of a forecast variable Y as a function of a set of explanatory variables X_1X1​ through X_kXk​.

**Return:** Profit or loss generated by an investment in an asset or a portfolio.

**Risk:** The chance an investment might not achieve its expected targets


### RSI
**RSI:** A momentum indicator that charts the strength of any moves in asset price.

## S

**Sharpe Ratio:** A measurement that help determine the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio/asset.

**Short:** When an investor borrows an asset and sells it the market.

**Standard Deviation:** Measures the variability of the expected rate of return of a portfolio/asset

**Stationary:** A time series is stationary when its statistical properties such as mean, variance, and covariance remain unchanged over time.

**Systematic risk:** The risk inherent to the entire market or market segment.

## T

**Tangency Portfolio:** The portfolio with the highest Sharpe Ration. the point where the CAL is tangent to the Efficient Frontier.

**Time Series:** An ordered sequence of values of a variable observed at equally spaced time intervals is referred to as a time series.

**Time Series Model:** A time series model is a function that relates the value of a time series to previous values of that time series, its errors, or other related time series.

## U

**Unsystematic risk:** Also known as diversifiable risk, is the risk that relates to a particular security or a portfolio of securities.

## V

**Variance:** A summary statistic (parameter) for a sample (population). It is usually denoted S2(σ2). It is the average of squared deviations from the mean.

## W

**Weights:** The ratio of capital composition within a portfolio.

**White noise** When there is no pattern whatsoever in the data series, it is said to represent white noise.
