## M1:Introduction to Models

 Quick take
 : 4  key mathematical functions used in models, and the essential vocabulary used to describe models.
 
 
 ### a.4 models
 linear
 power
 exponential
 logrithm
 
 meaning：
 exponential：– A one percent (proportionate) change in x corresponds to an approximate m percent (proportionate) change in y.
 
 The exponential function

• Essentialcharacteristic:
– the rate of change of y is proportional to y itself
• Interpretationofmforsmallvaluesofm(say-0.2≤m≤0.2):
– For every one-unit change in x, there is an approximate 100m% (proportionate) change in y
– Example: if m = 0.05, then a one-unit increase in x is associated with an approximate 5% increase in y




The log function
• Thelogfunctionisveryusefulformodelingprocessesthatexhibit
diminishing returns to scale
• Theseareprocessesthatincreasebutatadecreasingrate • Essentialcharacteristic:
– A constant proportionate change in x is associated with the same absolute change in y
 
 ### b.Lexicon
 Deterministic v. probabilistic/stochastic
 
 人为经验
Theory: given a set of assumptions and relationships, then what are the logical consequences?
 –  Example: if we assume that markets are efficient then what should the price of a stock option be?

机器血虚
Data: given a set of observations, how can we approximate the underlying process that generated them?

# Stage3:Financial Acumen for Non-Financial Manager

### M1: Introduction, Balance Sheet and Income Statement
This module was designed to give you a foundational overview of financial reporting and income statements. You’ll identify and analyze balance sheet equations and its key components such as assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity. Through examining a sample real-world financial statement, you’ll learn how to calculate income, revenue, and expenses transactions, and see how the income statement is linked to changes in the balance sheet. By the end of this module, you’ll have a better understanding of the key components in financial reporting and learn how to craft an accurate income statement for your organization.



-   Identify and analyze balance sheet equations and its key components such as assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity
-   Examine a sample real-world financial statement and calculate income, revenue, and expense transactions
-   Generate an accurate income statement for your organization


#### 三张表

Balance sheet
Income statement
Cash flow

The balance sheet shows the resources and claims on the resources AT A POINT IN TIME
• The income statement and cash flow statement provides information about how the balance sheet changes OVER A PERIOD OF TIME
• The cash flow statement tells you how the CASH account on the balance sheet changes over time
• The income statement tells you about how the RETAINED EARNINGS account on the balance sheet changes over time

#### 会计 accounting
More Timely Information Requires More Estimation
• Accounting systems slice the firm’s life into arbitrary periods (quarters and years)

#### Revenue 和Income的区别
一、revenue主要用于经管领域，最准确的中文翻译是“收**入**”，反义词是expense（支出）。

1.1 对企业而言，意思是“企业在_日常活动_中形成的、将导致所有者权益增加的、与所有者投入资本无关的**经济利益的总流入**”。

1.2 对国家而言，常见用法是[fiscal revenue](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=fiscal+revenue&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A1658229471%7D)（财政收入），意思是“政府为履行职能而筹集的税收收入、社会保险基金收入、[非税收入](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E9%9D%9E%E7%A8%8E%E6%94%B6%E5%85%A5&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A1658229471%7D)、国债等资金的总和。”

二、income含义有三：

2.1 用于法学领域最准确的中文翻译是“所得”，例如income tax（所得税），意思是“国家对企业和个人在一定时期内的各类所得征收的一种[直接税](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E7%9B%B4%E6%8E%A5%E7%A8%8E&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A1658229471%7D)。”

2.2 用于经管领域最准确的中文翻译是“收**益**”，与profit（利润）同义，一般income=revenue-expense。例如income statement（收益表）也被叫做利润表。net income就是“净利润”，investment income就是“投资收益”，interest income就是“[利息收益](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E5%88%A9%E6%81%AF%E6%94%B6%E7%9B%8A&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A1658229471%7D)”。

### M2:Cash Flow Statement
-   Identify and analyze balance sheet equations and its key components such as assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity
-   Examine a sample real-world financial statement and calculate income, revenue, and expense transactions
-   Generate an accurate income statement for your organization


### M3:Financial Statement Analysis
In this module, you’ll examine a systematic approach to ratio analysis and other common tools of financial statement analysis. You’ll develop an understanding of ratios and liquidity measures so you can accurately assess risk within your organization’s financial activities. You’ll discover different approaches to profitability measures such as Earnings Per Share (EPS), Return on Equity (ROE), and the Dupont Analysis. You will be able to match Return on Assets (ROA) to various types of companies and gain a better understanding of the drivers of ROA. Then, you’ll explore the concepts of sales revenue and different qualities of earnings. By the end of this module, you’ll understand the theoretical basis behind ratio analysis, and be able to employ different ratio analyses and accurately calculate profitability measures for your organization.


-   Assess risk within your organization's financial activities using ratios and liquidity measures
-   Identify different approaches to profitability measures such as Earnings Per Share (EPS), Return on Equity (ROE), and the Dupont Analysis
-   Apply different ratio analyses and accurately calculate profitability measures
### M4: Linking Non-Financial Metrics to Financial Performance
In this module, you’ll discover how to determine which non-financial performance measures predict financial results through asking these fundamental questions: Of the hundreds of non-financial measures, which are the key drivers of financial success? How do you rank or weight non-financial measures which don’t share a common denominator? And what performance targets are desirable? You’ll examine comprehensive examples of how companies have used accounting data to show how investments in non-financial dimensions pay off in the future and important organizational issues that commonly arise using these models. By the end of this module, you’ll know how predictive analytics can be used to determine what you should be measuring, how to weight different performance measures when trying to analyze potential financial results, how to make trade-offs between short-term and long-term objectives, and how to set performance targets for optimal financial performance.


-   Examine comprehensive examples of how companies have used accounting data to show how investments in non-financial dimensions pay off
-   Categorize different performance measures when trying to analyze potential financial results
-   Assess trade-offs between short-term and long-term objectives and set performance targets

# Stage4: Corporate Finance
Virtually every significant corporate decision is accompanied by some type of valuation often employing a discounted cash flow analysis - merger, acquisition, spin-off, divestiture, capital budgeting, carve-outs, initial public offerings (IPOs), leveraged buyouts (LBOs), etc. Treasury departments and corporate development offices in non-financial firms employ the tools from this course. Additionally, many non-finance related positions within corporations employ the tools from this course because of their importance in communicating with finance departments and because of their central role in capital budgeting decisions.

### M1:The time value of money.



#### CF &  PV & FV  & discount rate的关系

##### CF 
Hint: Recognize that this cash flow stream is an annuity and that the price of an asset is the present value of its future cash flows.)

#### Annuity 和 Perpetuity的关系

Assume that a bond makes 10 equal annual payments of \$1,000$1,000 starting one year from today. The bond will make an additional payment of \$100,000$100,000 at the end of the last year, year 10. (This security is sometimes referred to as a coupon bond.)

If the discount rate is 3.5\%3.5% per annum, what is the current price of the bond?

(Hint: Recognize that this bond can be viewed as two cash flow streams: (1) a 10-year annuity with annual payments of \$1,000$1,000, and (2) a single cash flow of \$100,000$100,000 arriving 10 years from today. Apply the tools you've learned to value both cash flow streams separately and then add.)


 A mortgage is just an annuity where the borrowed amount is the present value of the annuity.
### M2:Interest Rates
In this module, we wrap up the Time Value of Money topic with a discussion of inflation before moving on to our second topic, Interest Rates, and introducing our third topic, Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. By the end of this module, you should feel comfortable with discounting and compounding arbitrary cash flow streams in order to value different claims and make better financial decisions.

### M3:Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
This module continues our discussion of discounted cash flow analysis by way of a capital budgeting case. (You might want to download or view the Excel file, “Tablet Case Spreadsheet.xlsx,” that I use in the lectures, but it is not necessary for understanding the material.) By the end of this module, you should feel comfortable valuing claims and making financing decisions in which the timing of the cash flows and compounding of interest is arbitrary (e.g., annual, semi-quarterly, monthly, etc.). Having worked through the problems, you should also be more comfortable with real world financial decision making related to retirement savings, home financing and refinancing, auto leases, and other scenarios.

### M4:Return on Investment
By the end of this module, you should feel comfortable with the notion of free cash flow and the ability to apply a set of forecast drivers to project free cash flows into the future. These are some of the elements of a basic financial model, which we will use to come to a decision about the tablet project and to analyze the assumptions behind our valuation.
